            <ul>
                <li>Reduced time-to-market for brand migrations by 60%</li>
                <li>Improved baseline conversion by 12% across pilot brands</li>
                <li>Cut design and engineering duplication costs by £2M annually</li>
                <li>Established the first enterprise-wide design system supporting 2M+ guests per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="role-summary"><strong>My role:</strong> Principal Product Designer (Strategic Lead). I defined the UX architecture, led the cross-functional task force, built the design system from scratch, and secured C-suite buy-in for the "clean sheet" approach across 40+ brand stakeholders.</p>

            <h2>The problem we were solving</h2>
            <p>The organisation ran 40+ brand websites built for mixed B2B and B2C needs.</p>
            <p>This created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fragmented customer journeys with 300%+ variation in conversion rates</li>
                <li>Inconsistent quality and duplicated effort across brands</li>
                <li>18-month lead times for new features</li>
                <li>Poor performance, accessibility, and SEO outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PO1 was created to fix this at a system level.</p>
            <p>The goal was not to redesign a website. It was to build a repeatable B2C ecommerce capability that could scale.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Programme intent</h2>
            <p>PO1 set out to do three things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Move the business to an ecommerce-first model</li>
                <li>Create one consolidated platform and design system</li>
                <li>Enable faster, data-led iteration across brands</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This required changes to technology, design practice, team structure, and governance.</p>
            <p>The programme was brand-agnostic by design.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>My leadership challenge:</strong> The "clean sheet" principle was the hardest sell. It required navigating 10+ years of legacy pride from individual brand stakeholders. I used analytics audits to prove that legacy patterns were actively costing the business revenue, which shifted the conversation from opinion to evidence.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Guiding principles</h2>
            <p>I established five principles that shaped every decision:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start from a clean sheet</li>
                <li>Design for B2C only</li>
                <li>Optimise for performance and conversion first</li>
                <li>Validate assumptions early with real users</li>
                <li>Build once, reuse everywhere</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This avoided incremental improvement of legacy patterns.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Building the design system</h2>
            <p>I built the multi-brand design system from scratch.</p>
            <p><strong>The challenge:</strong> Create one system that could serve 40+ brands without destroying their individual identities.</p>
            <p><strong>My approach:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Separated structure from style using a token architecture</li>
                <li>Created a core component library (40 components)</li>
                <li>Built brand-specific theme layers</li>
                <li>Established clear governance and contribution models</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> New brand migrations dropped from 18 months to 6 weeks. Design-to-development handoff time reduced by 70%.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Key outcomes</h2>

            <h3>Team impact</h3>

                <li>Established first enterprise-wide design system</li>
                <li>Created repeatable discovery and validation process</li>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why this approach mattered</h2>
            <p>PO1 was designed to scale beyond a single launch.</p>
            <p>The structure allowed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple brands to migrate safely</li>
                <li>Patterns to be validated once and reused everywhere</li>
                <li>Teams to move faster without lowering quality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It created the foundation for long-term B2C growth, not a one-off redesign.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>My contribution:</strong> I defined the UX architecture, built the design system, led the cross-functional task force, and managed stakeholder alignment across 40+ brands. I established the principles, processes, and governance model that allowed this programme to succeed at scale.</p>
